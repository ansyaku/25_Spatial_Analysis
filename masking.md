# Masking

* Masking is a way to remove or hide unwanted pixels in an image so that they are not considered in further analysis. 
* What Does "Masked" Mean?
  * A masked image in Google Earth Engine (GEE) is an image where some pixels are transparent (ignored) and others remain visible.

In GEE, masking is done using binary values:
* **1 (valid pixels)** → These pixels remain visible and will be used in calculations.
* **0 (masked pixels)** → These pixels become transparent and are ignored in further processing.

# Purpose of Masking in Your Code
1. Focusing on Relevant Areas:
- The mask ensures that only pixels with B4 ≥ 0.3 are included in the area calculation.
- This could be used, for example, to identify areas with vegetation, water, or specific land cover types.

2. Accurate Area Calculation:
- Without masking, all pixels (including irrelevant ones) would be included in the area computation.
- The mask ensures that only pixels meeting the B4 ≥ 0.3 condition contribute to the total area.

3. Efficient Processing:
- Masked pixels are ignored in calculations, reducing computational load and improving efficiency.
